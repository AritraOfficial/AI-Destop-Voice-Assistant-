**AI Desktop Voice Assistant Project 0.0**

**Description:**
This project aims to create a basic desktop voice assistant using Python. The assistant can perform various tasks such as setting reminders, checking the weather, and providing simple information, all through voice commands.

**Features:**
1. **Voice Recognition:** Utilizes speech recognition to interpret user commands.
2. **Task Execution:** Executes basic tasks such as setting reminders, checking the weather, and providing information based on user queries.
3. **Desktop Integration:** Designed specifically for desktop platforms, making it convenient for users to interact with their computer through voice commands.

**Getting Started:**
 **Clone the Repository:**
   ```
   [git clone https://github.com/your_username/ai-desktop-voice-assistant.git
   cd ai-desktop-voice-assistant](https://github.com/AritraOfficial/AI_Desktop_Voice_Assistant_Project_0.0.git)
   ```



3. **Run the Application:**
   ```
   python main.py
   ```
   The application will start, and you can begin giving voice commands after the prompt.

**Usage:**
- Upon launching the application, wait for the prompt indicating that the assistant is ready to receive commands.
- Speak clearly and concisely, addressing the assistant with your desired task or query.
- For example:
  - "Set a reminder for tomorrow at 9 AM."
  - "What is the weather forecast for New York?"
  - "Tell me about Albert Einstein."
